# :robot: FraudDetection :car:

## :arrow_forward: Introduction
Bank transactions represent an important step for automation paying industry. Often times, these can be farudulos, leading to losing a great amount of money. This project try to identify those transactions and display a map showing them

## :memo: Description

Consistency represent the key factor that reveals the fraudulos attempts. The project implements self organised maps imported from from pypi.org that detects the unexpected details among transactions. Dispaling the map of organised data, it becomes obvious if a transaction is fraudulos or not.
